This is my first try of making something of my own on github using the commands I've learnt. Don't know what project I should do. But my Sir once saidthat start projects on your own day to day life. Here too I couldn't think of much so just making some lists of people and stuff I do.
Hope the next project I do would be much better and meaningful.
